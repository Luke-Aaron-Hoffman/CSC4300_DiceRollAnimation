# CSC4300_DiceRollAnimation

## What is it?

This is an interactive animation that rolls a die that is selected with a button using HTML. The animation itself was done using three.js, and so much of the logic behind the animation is also done using javascript.

## How does it work?

You can find an example of this animation [here.](http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~lhoffman/csc4300/Dice/)

## Notes:

The textures used were created by myself using photoshop.
